## FAQ

### Why another routine app?

Just because I don't usually like to use existing apps, and because I wanted to build my own app to solve my own problems, and learn along the way.

### Why saving locally and not on the cloud?

For the v0.1 release I just wanted to focus on the core functionality and the user experience. I plan to add a back-end for the 0.2 release, with user authentication and data storage in a database.

### Do you plan to make it a commercial product?

For now, just doing for fun, but I plan to create a landing page to mimic a real product and also market it to my network and friends.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Localization (English, Portuguese)
- [ ] Saving data on the server.
- [ ] User authentication.
- [ ] Notifications.
- [ ] Add a landing page to show the app and it's features.
- [ ] Filter activities by tag.
- [ ] Add a search bar to search for activities.
